# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was initialized using Create React App.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

`npm start`
Starts the development server and opens http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

The page automatically reloads when you make changes. Any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

`npm test`
Runs the test suite in interactive watch mode. For more details, refer to the running tests documentation.

`npm run build`
Builds the application for production, outputting the optimized files to the build directory. The production build is optimized for best performance, including minified code and hashed filenames.

Your application will be ready for deployment. For more information, see the deployment documentation.

`npm run eject`
Warning: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot revert!

If the default build setup does not meet your needs, you can eject to gain full control over the configuration. This command copies all configuration files and dependencies (like webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project.

You are not required to eject for small to medium-sized deployments. The curated feature set is generally sufficient. Eject only if you need to customize the setup.
